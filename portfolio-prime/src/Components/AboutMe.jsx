        I have been working for the past 4 years with JavaScript, and for the
        last couple of years, I’ve been writing and refactoring code while
        connecting RESTful APIs using <span>React</span> and
        <span> TypeScript</span>. I’m committed to delivering clean, structured,
        and highly interactive experiences that elevate your online presence.
        Whether you're launching a new venture or refining an existing platform,
        my goal is to turn your digital vision into reality.
